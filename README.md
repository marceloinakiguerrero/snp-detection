# snp-detection
This is a pipeline to detect SNPs.



## How to use:
- Prepare a list of your samples you wish to get variant calls for.
- Obtain the reference genome (.fa format)
- Obtain the forward and reverse reads (.fastq.gz format)
- Populate "experimental_data.csv" with the samples you wish to run. You will need to include a reference genome .fa file
